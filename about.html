            <div class="about"> I am an environmentalist, a student, a wanderer, and lover of life. My passion and curiousity drive my ambition to learn, travel, and explore every opportunity. I hope to influence those around me to love the Earth and live life on the edge.    
              <br><br>  The passion I have for my education in Environmental Engineering has its roots in my travel experience. During my undergraduate career, I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to volunteer in Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Haiti. 
                From this rich period of personal growth I acquired a basic understanding of Spanish, an identity as a global citizen, and the skills to independently navigate in a foreign culture. 
               <br><br> Most importantly, these experiences have instilled in me a passion for environmental awareness. I was able to observe first hand that the people in these developing countries are utterly dependent on the environment around them, and yet generally lack a concern for pollution and consideration for the sustainability of natural resources. As my desire to travel has grown with each abroad experience, so has my awareness of environmental needs. 
                <br><br> It seems appropriate to support my next leap in life with a study abroad experience, expanding my education in Australia, whose institutes are at the forefront of environmental technology and research. I believe that this experience will provide a unique context for exploring the limits of my education before beginning graduate studies.
                This experience will also allow me to explore a culture that I am enamored with, surf the waves that I stalk pictures of, and make friends and professional connections in a country that I dream to one day call home.  </div>
