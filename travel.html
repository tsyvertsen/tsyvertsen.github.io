        <div class="p1"><h1> Most recently, </h1> <div class="p2">I've had the opportunity to travel across Europe through a competition for Red Bull called "Can You Make It". The goal was to make it from a certain starting point to Berlin through several checkpoints in several countries, without using any money- only Red Bull as currency. As mad as it sounds it was an absolutely epic adventure. Here's the break down from start to Finish. <br> </div> <h2>How did we get into this mess?</h2>  <div class="p2">  Here's the application video that landed me and my two good friends, Kate Wenzel and Natalie Palmer, a flight to Europe and a life-changing week:<br></div>

<h2>Arrival...</h2><p> Our starting point was in Vienna, Austria. We were greeted at the airport by the Austrian version of Lenny Kravitz, taken to our hotel for the night, and met the other absolutely outrageous teams from all over the world. That night we were treated with an Austrian feast and a raging party with native line dancers. Also, a vegetarian, I ate "black pudding" thinking it was a dessert. Its fried blood, for those of you who don't know.
        </p>
        <h2>Day One</h2><p> We were dropped off by the Red Bull party bus that still smelled like champagne at an empty amusement park. Here we were debriefed, left our money and phones behind, and didn't look back with only a 24 pack of Red Bull in hand. <br>  After attempting to hitchhike, we were picked up by a French priest and dropped off in the middle of nowhere in Austria. Not even half way to the first checkpoint and four hours later, near tears, a shuttle driver offered to take us to the airport. After running into a bachelor party and failing to score a free taxi, we decided to talk to some well-dressed flight attendants who happened to be operations managers, with the right connections in marketing. Next thing we know, we're trading three cans for a FREE FLIGHT to Innsbruck. I can't even describe the mental transition from low to high, from the side of the road in tears to a smooth flight into the Austrian Alps. We skated to our checkpoint from the airport, with a river and the most beautiful mountains in the background.<br><br>   We were greeted at the checkpoint (a super cool bar) with smiles, disbelief, and beers. We relaxed, hung out with a team from Hungary, explored the beautiful Harry Potter style city of Innsbruck, and skated around for hours. </p>
        
             <h2>Day Two</h2><p>The next morning we woke up early for the checkpoint challenge to earn some more cans. We took a lift all the way up the mountain, got to witness a mountain bike race, and hiked to the top peak. Literally breathtaking views, and we even got to ski. <br> We made it down the mountain and headed to the train station and met people for a few hours to try and convince people to trade us train tickets. We ended up filming with some local film makers who were creating a video in 48 hour for some sort of film festival. Finally we rounded three tickets to the nearest stop toward Venice, and boarded the train with a couple other teams. Arriving in Venice was absolutely beautiful. We were greeted with the best pizza I've ever eaten, and a challenge that led us running around the streets of Venice to find some dude dress as a king. We failed. <br> Meeting back with another team from Hungary, we left out bags with some guy at the train station and decided to explore Venice. We traded Red Bull for wine and snook onto a gondola to celebrate the eve of my birthday. Although it was magical, we didn’t want to sleep at the train station so hopped on the next train out. Apparently the train didn’t run overnight, so we got off at the next stop with some awesome Italian guys who let us stay at their place while they went to party. </p><br> 
     
    <h2>Day Three</h2><p>We woke up early the next morning as the Italian guy stumbled in, apologizing for not bringing croissants. Seriously? We headed to the train station with no real goals and failed miserably. We decided to hitchhike instead. We caught a ride to Milan with one of the most interesting people I've ever met. His tiny car was packed with his "art" and we squeezed in, literally holding his work on our heads. The accordion playing music therapist/artist took us to his parents’ house in Milan, and made me an authentic Italian birthday lunch that I will never forget. His parents, two adorable barely English speaking Italians, came home, we took sake shots and drank espresso, sang and played the piano. His father gave me 'un regalo' which was a decorated pill box. After our perfect celebration, we headed to the train station. <br> We easily found an Australian man who traded us cans for a train ticket to the stop before Lugano, Switzerland. Next thing we know we're luging down to mountains of Lugano to our next checkpoint, soon to find that it's all the way up the other side of the mountain and the buses have stopped running for the day. Considering the streets were clean enough to eat off of, we decide to post up at a quaint little park to sleep. I stopped a guy on a skateboard to see if there was any cool little bars to meet people, and next thing we know he's inviting us to stay at his flat and introduces us to his beautiful friends. <br>
     We went to his place, showered (finally) and sank into one of the most comfortable atmospheres I've ever experienced. They made us dinner, we ate. They turned out the lights and entered the room with a cake and a candle, singing happy birthday in Italian. I cried a little bit, it was the sweetest thing a stranger has ever done for me, let alone take us into their home. We ended up going out to a local bar where we sang drinking songs till close. </p>
     <h2>Day Four</h2><p> We woke up the next morning and  to explore the town a bit with our new friends who took off work to hang out with us (or was too hung over from our shenanigans the night before). We scooped another friend along the way who willingly cut classes to show us to our next checkpoint. We took a lift to the top of the mountain to reach the checkpoint. Again, the checkpoint was at a picturesque spot with impeccable views of the lake of Lugano. Instead of rushing to our next destination, we decided to relax and take a new outlook on the competition. We ate, drank and hung out with our new friends. They took us to a spot where people often jumped off of into the lake during the summer. Although Kate literally thought we were going to get hypothermia, we were determined. Freezing, but quite refreshing, and we are still alive. We headed back to Alex's place and decided to hitch hike to Zurich. We were almost arrested (apparently it’s illegal to hitch hike on the highway), so we headed back to Alex's and decided to stay one more night. He graciously took us back in, shared his wine, and called his friends over for a chilled night. </p>
     
    <h2>Day Five</h2><p>We woke up at the crack of the dawn to catch the train to Zurich. Alex woke up, supplying coffee, sugar cubes, and good wishes. I wish we could have taken him with us. At the train station, we simply asked the ticket taker if we could get on for the whole Red Bull case, and he said 'uh yep'. It was almost too easy. The train ride through the hills of Switzerland was absolutely beautiful, passing waterfalls and quaint colorful mountainside towns. We arrived in a rainy Zurich and met a Swiss Olympic jockey who translated for us and showed us around. To kill time till the checkpoint opened, we traded for samosas and coffee, and talked for hours with Meagen. We arrived to the checkpoint at a university bar where our challenge was basically to eat chocolate with a Swiss army knife (apparently it’s a child's game?). It was awesome. We headed out to explore Zurich a bit, then jumped on a train to the Frankfurt airport in search of another flight.   </p>
     
     <h2>Day Six</h2>
     <p>We woke up after a good sleep in the airport, and set out to work out magic. After a valiant effort, some cappuccinos and croissants, we gave up and headed to the checkpoint. We skated through Frankfurt and over the bridge of locks and arrived at a rowing club where the checkpoint was located. We played soccer, filmed a skate video, danced and explored Frankfurt. Several teams were there at the same time so we decided to stay the night. We grilled out, had some authentic franks and cold German beers, and danced all night. Overall one of the best parties I've ever partaken in.</p>
     <h2>Day Seven</h2>
     <p> We decided to hit one last checkpoint in Hamburg, so we jumped on the train and made it there in no time. We hit the checkpoint at a sketchy little bar, then headed straight to Berlin. We lucked out at the train station, as one of the other teams schmoozed a conductor who let all five teams on the train to Berlin. We arrived with a feeling of relief, and started drinking. We hit a pizza place near the train station where a super nice server gave us delicious pizza, beers, a place to stay for the night and leave our bags while we explored. We roamed Berlin for hours, through parks and historical sites. We headed back to the restaurant to meet up with out new friend and crashed for the night to prepare for the final day.</p>
     <br><br>
     <h2>Big FINALE!</h2>
     <p> we hopped on an underground bus to the final gate. As a grand entrance we skated in, being pulled by three bicyclists. We sprayed Red Bulls, hugged, and tackled each other in sheer joy. <br> We then loaded a Red Bull party bus to the fancy hotel, whose lobby looked like a homeless shelter now thanks to all of the incoming teams. We checked in and went out to explore Berlin WITH MONEY to treat ourselves. <br>
We got ready for what we were told was going to be the most epic party in the world. We were first treated with a feast, speeches, a beautiful video and a collage put together by the Red Bull staff. Then we set out for the roof top party of a lifetime. "the most epic party in the world" was an accurate description, to say the least. </p>
                   
Stay tuned for the next adventure :]
